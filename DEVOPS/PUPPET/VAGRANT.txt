	 Vagrant - The command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines.
	         - It provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments .
			 - To achieve its magic, Vagrant stands on the shoulders of giants. 
			   Machines are provisioned on top of VirtualBox, VMware, AWS, or any other provider.
			   Then, industry-standard provisioning tools such as shell scripts, Chef, or Puppet,
			   can be used to automatically install and configure software on the machine.
			   
	 Vagrnat Installation - Choose Proper installer or package then proceed as per OS standard 
	                      - Can be installed as Ruby Gem , but not supported anymore
						  - vagrant will be added to system path 
						  
						  
	 Project Set up       - vagrant init - This will place vagrant file in current directory 
	 
	 Boxes   - Instead of building a virtual machine from scratch, which would be a slow and tedious process,
               Vagrant uses a base image to quickly clone a virtual machine. These base images are known as 
			   "boxes" in Vagrant
	 
	         - vagrant box add <userName/boxName>  - This will download the box named "<boxName>"
			 
			 - In Vagrant file 
			    Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
					config.vm.box = "hashicorp/precise64"
					config.vm.box_version = "1.1.0"
					config.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box"
				end
